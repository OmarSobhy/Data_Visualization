At the end of this section, describe the questions that you plan on exploring over the course of the report. Try to build your report around the analysis of at least one dependent variable and three independent variables. If you're not sure what questions to ask, then make sure you familiarize yourself with the dataset, its variables and the dataset context for ideas of what to explore.\n",

This movie isn't really about gentrification but the dynamic is here : the boy from the powerful family and the girl from the poor district : if the beginning is light and happy and makes think it will be superficial musical comedy, the story takes a dramatic turn as soon as the illegal mother is arrested : strangely, the songs are much better, especially Balavoines « save love » ! By dealing with the immigrant fate, the movie really wins a heart, all the more that this subject is usually put in the closet. The lines are powerful with one side talking about file, number and the other fighting with person, family !
